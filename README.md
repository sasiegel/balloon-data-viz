# Balloon Data Viz
A fun, simple graphical visulization for viewing active users. The number of balloons in the environment are number of users. When a user logs in their balloon floats to the top. It slowly floats to the ground until they log in again.

## TODO
- The text stutters as the balloons move. It seems like the problem is with how text is rendered in Canvas. The solution might be to generate an image of the text and use that instead :shrug:
- Create two more hot air balloons so there is a top three
- Come up with a system for the regular balloons' colors. I was thinking it could be by group/team.
